# COVID--19-Dataset
Performed Data Cleaning and Made Dashboards In Tableau on COVID–19

First Dashboard :

COVID – 19Automated Tracker –  I have made an automated dashboard to track COVID – 19 Cases worldwide. Since it is a dynamic dashboard so this data is going to update if further new data is added. 
I have used a Line Chart which shows COVID-19 Cases for a particular period , used different icons to make my dashboard interactive , created different calculated fields so as to create new data which is useful for my dashboard and added reference line at the average cases mark so we can see how the COVID Cases differ with respect to Average Value. 
Source- I extracted the dataset from https://datahub.io/core/covid-19
(File Used –worldwide - aggregate)
